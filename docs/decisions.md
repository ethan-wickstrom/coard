# Decisions

## Use doubly linked list for list of LCDPosition

## Use vector for pairing Timestamp to LCDPosition

- we will not know the size of the vector at compile time

## While segment in progress perform FFT with only surronding points

## Once segment is done, perform full FFT with all segment points.
